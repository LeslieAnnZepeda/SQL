SELECT distinct count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.Jansales
Where Length(OrderID)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT distinct count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.Jansales
Where Length(OrderID)=6
And Product="iPhone"

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct(customers.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.customers
inner join BIT_DB.febsales
on customers.order_id=febsales.orderID
Where length(orderID)=6

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.jansales
group by product
order by price asc
limit 1

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT SUM(quantity)* Price As Total_revenue,
product
FROM BIT_DB.jansales
group by product

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT SUM(quantity)* Price As Total_revenue,

Where location= "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
group by product

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(distinct customers.acctnum), AVG(price*quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT Join Customers
On febsales.orderID= customers.Order_id
Where febsales.quantity> 2
And length(orderid)=6
